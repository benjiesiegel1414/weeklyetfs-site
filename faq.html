    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;color:#555;font-size:1.1em">Answers to the most common questions about WeeklyETFs.com</p>

    <h2>What is WeeklyETFs.com?</h2>
    <p><strong>WeeklyETFs.com is the first website/tool of its kind.</strong><br>
    WeeklyETFs.com shows about 100 of the most popular, well-known weekly-paying dividend ETFs across the stock market. This tool is special because it was built by a dividend investor… <strong>FOR</strong> dividend investors. The site shares accurate, important information that dividend-income-focused investors are craving. Best of all — WeeklyETFs.com is <strong>100% FREE</strong> to use for everyone!</p>

    <h2>How are the ETFs picked to be added?</h2>
    <p>As a full-time dividend investor, I have a good read on the dividend investing “scene” and know which ETFs are popular and in demand. I include any and all dividend ETFs that fit that criteria, along with those I personally find interesting and want to watch closely. I will be adding and removing ETFs often and welcome the community's input on this.</p>

    <h2>How do you find the Dividend Yield?</h2>
    <p>The dividend yield for each ETF is updated as many times per week as possible, setting this tool apart from others. The yield is sourced from each ETF’s main website. Yields can be inaccurate at times, but I do my best to ensure they are as accurate as humanly possible! I update them by hand and don’t scrape data, which often leads to inaccuracies.</p>

    <h2>What is Price Decay?</h2>
    <p>The Price Decay metric is determined by whether the ETF has grown or declined in price since inception. This is just one metric and does not indicate if an ETF is “good” or “bad,” but it’s a helpful data point for the community. This metric can be inaccurate at times, like all data on this website.</p>
